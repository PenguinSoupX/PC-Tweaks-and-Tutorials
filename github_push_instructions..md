To push updates to a GitHub repository from the terminal, you'll need to use the Git command-line tools. Here are the general steps to push updates to a GitHub repository:

1. Navigate to your project directory using the terminal. You can use the `cd` (change directory) command to do this.

**cd /path/to/your/project**

2. Check the status of your Git repository to see what changes you've made and which files are ready to be committed. Use the following command:

**git status**

3. If you have uncommitted changes, you can add them to the staging area using the `git add` command. For example, to add all changes, you can use:

**git add .**

4. Commit the changes with a meaningful commit message using the `git commit` command. For example:

**git commit -m "Update: Add new feature"**

5. Finally, push your changes to the GitHub repository using the `git push` command:

**git push**

6. If you haven't already set up a remote repository, you'll need to configure your remote repository URL using the following command, where `username` is your GitHub username and `repository_name` is the name of your GitHub repository:

**git remote add origin https://github.com/PenguinSoupX/PC-Tweaks-and-Tutorials **

Replace `username` and `repository_name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

Now, when you run `git push`, it will push your changes to the GitHub repository you've specified.

7. If you're not already authenticated with GitHub, Git might prompt you to enter your GitHub username and password or use a personal access token. You can also set up SSH keys for authentication to avoid entering your credentials each time.

Note that you must have the necessary permissions to push changes to the GitHub repository. If it's a private repository, you'll need the appropriate access rights.
